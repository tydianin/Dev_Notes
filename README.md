### Remote Workflow

When working IRL, fork first.  
`git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git`  
<https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-clone>  
  
Commit often.  
`git add [<pathspec>...]`  
<https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-add>  
  
`git commit [-m <msg>]`  
<https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-commit>  
  
`git push [<repository>]`  
<https://www.git-scm.org/docs/git-push>  
  
When working IRL, submit a pull request.  
`git request-pull [-p] <start> <URL> [<end>]`  
<https://www.git-scm.org/docs/git-request-pull>  

### Status/History

Check status often to make sure your assumptions are correct.  
`git status [<options>...] [--] [<pathspec>...]`  
<https://www.git-scm.org/docs/git-status>  
  
Check the log to make sure it's not your fault.  
`git log [<options>] [<revision-range>] [[--] <path>...]`  
<https://www.git-scm.org/docs/git-log>
