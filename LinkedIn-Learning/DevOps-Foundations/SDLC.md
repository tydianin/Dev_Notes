# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

ISO/IEC 12207 "defines all the tasks required for developing and maintaining software."  
"A methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process."  

## Plan (Requirement Analysis)

Performed by senior team members using input from stakeholders.  
Used to:  

- Plan basic project approach
- Conduct economical/operational/technical feasibility study
- Plan quality assurance requirements
- Identify risks

Helps to create a well-structured plan to maximize success and minimize risk.  

## Define (Requirements)

### Software Requirement Specification

Clearly define and document the product requirements for approval.  

## Design (Product Architecture)

Software architects will use the SRS to determine various approaches for the product.  
Each design will define:  

1. All architectural modules of the product
2. Communication and data flow representation to/from external parties
3. Internal design from a high-level low-detail perspective

### Design Document Specification (DDS)

All approaches determined will be documented in the DDS.  
DDS is reviewed by stakeholders and best design is selected.  

## Build (Development)

Code is written per DDS in a detailed and organized manner.  
Coding languages and tools are chosen with respect to the product.  

## Testing

All stages have testing involved, but QA testing is the most known.  
Software is tested to report, track, fix, and retest defects.  

## Deploy (Market and Maintenance)

Once tested and ready, the product is released to an appropriate setting.  
Some software is released to the public.  
Some software goes through User Acceptance Testing (UAT).  
Feedback is gathered and can be used to determine a launch, delay, or mix.
